I’m not Muslim, and neither is the author, so what I’m saying may not be entirely correct.

We created you from a single (pair) of a male and a female and made you into nations and tribes that ye may know each other (not that ye may despise each other). Verily the most honoured of you in the sight of Allah is (He who is) the most righteous of you. And Allah has full knowledge and is well acquainted (with all things).” — Yusuf Ali Quran 49:13\n\nIn the Hadith, it is similar to Leviticus, in the sense that the strict rules are followed by very few people today. For example, seduction by women. Would they punish someone for being seduced by a woman? Most likely not. So why get punished for liking the same gender? The sharia law gives no specific punishment for homosexuality either.\n\nPeople are searching for a reason to back up their homophobia. Not all Muslims are homophobic, and the ones who use religion to back themselves up are setting a double-standard.\n\nI’m sorry that you live with homophobic people. Your sexuality is *not* a sin.
